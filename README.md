Pirouette Bindings
==================

This repo contains the Pirouette bindings for iOS apis, and will contain Sample projects
in the future.

It does not contain the native driver code.  For that you need to download [the Piroette package](eventual url here) or
check things out from the [the EchoJS github repo](https://github.com/toshok/echo-js), which contains and builds these
bindings.
